## Goal and Purpose
Python is cross platform, so why shouldn't the tools to interact with the command line?

Curses only works on Linux and BSD terminals. There is nothing that had provided a 1-to-1 experience. (Believe me, I've checked) There were specialized libraries out there like [Colorama](#) and [Python Prompt Toolkit](#), but I felt they were too complicated or niche. When I came across Peter Brittain's [asciimatics](#), it was incredibly straight forward and intuitive. Though he had specific goals in mind, the Screen portion of the library was exactly what I needed. There have been modifications to that file here, but originating [credits](#asciimatics) go to him.

When creating command line tools, aside from passing in flags or calling --help, the main interaction is simply a process of answering questions to get what you want. Intermezzo should try to ease the process of getting users quickly to what they are looking for and eliminating open-ended confusion around passing flags and parameters.
